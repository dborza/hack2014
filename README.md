Code presented at a local hackaton

We offer a solution for monitoring the bike fleet of a future SmartCity.

The solution is constituted of the following components

* iPad app that lets you search for nearby available bikes and 'book' them while also monitoring the whole fleet
* server side backend for managing the bikes, users and their positions
* Android app that simulates a gps-emitting bike
